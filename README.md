# react-native-notes

These are notes I created when learning react-native.

## Getting Started Reference:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

## Setting Up:

The easiest way to get started is with Expo Go

```
npx create-expo-app my-project-name

```

Then, install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.

## Core Components and Native Components

https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components

"React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platformâ€™s native capabilities."

### Views and mobile development

"In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI"

### Native Components

"Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps."
