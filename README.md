# react-native-notes

These are notes I created when learning react-native.


## Getting Started Reference:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started


## Setting Up:

The easiest way to get started is with Expo Go

```
npx create-expo-app my-project-name

```

Then, install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
